# 🎯 Java Design Patterns (GoF) Collection

Welcome to the **Java Design Patterns (GoF)** repository! This project demonstrates the power of **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns with real-world, **mini systems** implemented in Java. Each pattern is clearly explained and organized into categories with dedicated examples.

## 🧠 About the Project

This repository is designed to help Java developers understand and implement core **Design Patterns** using practical, easy-to-understand **mini Java systems**. It covers **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns, following best coding practices.

## 🧰 Covered Design Patterns

### 🔨 Creational Patterns
✔️ **Abstract Factory** – Create families of related objects without specifying classes
✔️ **Factory Method** – Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide the instantiation
✔️ **Singleton** – Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global access point
- **Prototype** – Clone objects instead of creating new ones

### 🏗️ Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** – Bridge between incompatible interfaces
✔️ **Decorator** – Attach new behaviors to objects dynamically
✔️ **Facade** – Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
✔️ **Proxy** – Represent another object with more control or access

### 🔁 Behavioral Patterns
✔️ **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass requests along a chain of handlers
- **State** – Alter behavior when an object’s internal state changes
- **Strategy** – Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
✔️ **Observer** – Notify multiple objects about state changes
