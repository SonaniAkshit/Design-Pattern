## Introduction
Understanding design patterns is crucial for writing robust, maintainable, and scalable software. This repository provides a comprehensive guide to the most common design patterns used in Java programming. Each pattern includes an explanation, UML diagram, and code example.

## Design Patterns Overview
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

### Creational Patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, increasing flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method**: Creates instances of several derived classes.
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates instances of several families of classes.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype**: Creates a new object by copying an existing one.

### Structural Patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible classes to work together.
- **Bridge**: Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Adds additional behaviors to objects dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request among a chain of handlers.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Interpreter**: Implements a specialized language.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
- **Mediator**: Defines simplified communication between classes.
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state.
- **Observer**: Allows a subject to notify observers of changes.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps.
- **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure.
