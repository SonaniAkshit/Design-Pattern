# 🎯 Java Design Patterns (GoF) Collection

Welcome to the **Java Design Patterns (GoF)** repository! This project demonstrates the power of **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns through real-world **mini systems** implemented in Java. Each pattern is neatly explained and organized into categories with dedicated examples.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This repository is built to help Java developers **learn, understand, and implement** core **Design Patterns** through practical, easy-to-understand **mini Java systems**. It covers the three main categories:

- 🛠️ **Creational Patterns**
- 🏗️ **Structural Patterns**
- 🔁 **Behavioral Patterns**

All examples follow **best coding practices** and include visual aids and commentary to enhance comprehension.

## 📁 Project Structure


- 📂 Example path:
Design-Patterns/ Creational Patterns/ AbstractFactory Pattern/ src/ Food_Ordering_System/

---

### Each pattern is organized in its own folder and includes:

- 📄 Java source code
- 🧪 A mini project/system implementing the pattern
- 📘 Inline comments, structure diagram, class diagram, participants, and consequences
