# üéØ Java Design Patterns (GoF) Collection 

Welcome to the **Java Design Patterns (GoF)** repository! This project demonstrates the power of **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns through real-world **mini systems** implemented in Java. Each pattern is neatly explained and organized into categories with dedicated examples.

---

# üß† About the Project

This repository is built to help Java developers **learn, understand, and implement** core **Design Patterns** through practical, easy-to-understand **mini Java systems**. It covers the three main categories:

- üõ†Ô∏è **Creational Patterns**
- üèóÔ∏è **Structural Patterns**
- üîÅ **Behavioral Patterns**

All examples follow **best coding practices** and include visual aids and commentary to enhance comprehension.

- üìÇ Example path:
Design-Patterns/ Creational Patterns/ AbstractFactory Pattern/ src/ Food_Ordering_System/

### Each pattern is organized in its own folder and includes:

- üìÑ Java source code
- üß™ A mini project/system implementing the pattern
- üìò Inline comments, structure diagram, class diagram, participants, and consequences

## üíª Language & Tools

- üß± **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ‚úÖ **Status:** All implemented patterns are compiled and tested with sample use cases

# üìò What is a Design Pattern?

## ‚úÖ Definition (Based on GoF)

A **design pattern** is a **reusable solution** to a **common problem** that occurs in software design.

It is **not a complete code**, but a **template or guide** for how to solve a problem that keeps coming up in different projects.

> **GoF Definition:**  
> "*A design pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.*"

---

## üß† Key Points

- Design patterns are **tried and tested solutions**.
- They are **language-independent** (but can be implemented in Java, C++, etc.).
- Improve **code reuse**, **flexibility**, and **maintainability**.
- GoF categorized **23 design patterns** into:
   - **Creational Patterns**
   - **Structural Patterns**
   - **Behavioral Patterns**

# üß≠ How to Select a Design Pattern & Solve Design Problems ? (GoF Way)

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Approach from GoF

The **Gang of Four (GoF)** suggests using patterns by **understanding the problem first**, then finding a pattern that fits. Here's how:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Understand the Problem

- **What are you trying to solve?**
- Is it about **object creation**, **object structure**, or **object behavior**?
- Example questions:
   - Do you want to restrict object creation? (‚Üí *Creational*)
   - Do you want to make objects easier to change or extend? (‚Üí *Structural*)
   - Do you want objects to communicate flexibly? (‚Üí *Behavioral*)

---

## üîç 2. Classify the Problem

Check what kind of problem you're solving:

| Type         | Pattern Category |
|--------------|------------------|
| Object creation | Creational       |
| Class structure | Structural       |
| Object behavior | Behavioral       |

---

## üß© 3. Look for Similar Use Cases

Read the **intent** and **applicability** section of each pattern in the GoF book.

Example:
> Want to ensure only one instance of a class?  
> ‚úÖ Use **Singleton Pattern**

---
# üí° What Do You Mean by "Instance" in Java?

## ‚úÖ Definition

An **instance** is a **concrete object** created from a **class**.  
You can think of a class as a **blueprint**, and an instance as the **actual object** built using that blueprint.

---

## üè† Real-life Analogy

- **Class** = House Blueprint
- **Instance** = The actual House built from that blueprint

So when you create an object using `new`, you're **instantiating** a class ‚Äî creating an instance!

---

## ‚òï Java Example

```java
class Student {
    String name;

    Student(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("Aman"); // s1 is an instance of Student
        Student s2 = new Student("Riya"); // s2 is another instance

        s1.sayHello();  // Output: Hello, my name is Aman
        s2.sayHello();  // Output: Hello, my name is Riya
    }
}
```
---
## üß† 4. Use Pattern Selection Hints (GoF Tips)

GoF provides clues based on problem types:

| Situation | Pattern Suggestion |
|-----------|--------------------|
| You want to vary object creation | Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype |
| You want one object only | Singleton |
| You want to compose objects into trees | Composite |
| You want to change behavior at runtime | Strategy, State |
| You want to avoid tight coupling | Observer, Mediator |

---

## ‚òï Example: Solving with Design Pattern in Java

**Problem:** You need to create different types of documents (PDF, Word) but don‚Äôt want to hardcode creation.

**Solution:** Use **Factory Method** pattern.

```java
abstract class Document {
    public abstract void open();
}

class PDFDocument extends Document {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening PDF Document");
    }
}

class WordDocument extends Document {
    public void open() {
        System.out.println("Opening Word Document");
    }
}

abstract class Application {
    public abstract Document createDocument();
}

class PDFApp extends Application {
    public Document createDocument() {
        return new PDFDocument();
    }
}

class WordApp extends Application {
    public Document createDocument() {
        return new WordDocument();
    }
}
```
